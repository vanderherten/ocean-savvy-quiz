# OCEAN SAVVY QUIZ

The Ocean Savvy Quiz is a site that invites people to test their knowledge of Oceanography. The website hopes to demonstrate in a fun way how vanilla JavaScript gets implemented in a real-world game context. The Ocean Savvy Quiz will be targeted towards people who not only love JavaScript, but also have an 'ocean of curiosity'. The site is a fully responsive JavaScipt dynamic interactive featured game that will allow users to not only test their knowledge but also to learn about the world's ocean.
